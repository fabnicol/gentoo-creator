
The source package of the `uuid` auxiliary tool has been added to enhance
portability.
Should you need to install it, please perform installation as follows:
   
+ unpack: `tar xzvf libuuid-1.0.3a.tar.gz`   
+ cd libuuid-1.0.3
+ ./configure && make && sudo make install

Finally check that `which uuid` has zero exit code.
